Hi. I'm Brian. I've been working in the technology and IT field for quite a while now, but this is really my first attempt at a website for me to post things on. Kinda the point of a website, right? Currently, I'm a cyber security manager for a healthcare organization, and there is NEVER any shortage of work there.

I'm also a D&D DM (and occasional player as well), I enjoy camping and always love a good book. Why does this feel like a dating profile? You can find my links to YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter below where I do all kinds of interesting gaming and D&D things.

**Beardsen Gaming** is the name under which I do all my D&D and DM tutorial content as well.  You can find us on YouTube and streaming on Twitch using the links below as well.

Any other questions, feel free to drop me an email!
